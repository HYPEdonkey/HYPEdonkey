My name is Nigel Cokelek and I have been learning programming languages on and off throughout my college and university years, now I am currently working on
an online bootcamp with CoGrammar to learn the fundamental skills before becoming a software engineer.

The programming language I will be focusing on will be Python and I am looking to not only complete this CoGrammar Software Engineering Bootcamp; but to also complete the Harvard CS50x Online Course. This will help propel me with a solid fundamental understanding of programming through the language of Python.

Looking to boost my knowledge of programming each day and if there are any interesting projects to take on, I would be willing to have a go at what I can with
the skills I have at the time. Would love to one day work in the gaming industry and have an impact to the creation of the game, also hopefully imparting my influence
into the direction and vision of the game.

If you would like to reach out to me, you can contact me via my email; Cokeleknigel@yahoo.co.uk

Also make the best cup of tea in London but while in the office will probably only make one for myself.
